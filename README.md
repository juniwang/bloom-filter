# bloom-filter
Example implementation for bloom filter(BF) and counter bloom filter(CBF).

- Examples: See `Program.cs`.
- See `HashProvider.cs` to see the implementation of kinds of hash methods.
- See `HashFunction.cs` for known hash methods which acturally call `HashProvider`. It's easy to write a new `HashFunction`.
